# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

---

## What are CNNs?

- Specialized neural networks for image processing
- Inspired by the visual cortex of animals
- Efficient at recognizing patterns and features

---

## Key Components of CNNs

- **Convolutional Layers**
  - Apply filters to input images
  - Extract features like edges and textures

- **Activation Functions**
  - Non-linear functions (e.g., ReLU) introduced after convolution
  - Adds non-linearity to the model

- **Pooling Layers**
  - Reduce dimensionality
  - Common techniques: Max Pooling, Average Pooling

## CNN Architecture

1. **Input Layer**
   - Raw image data

2. **Convolutional Layer**
   - Filters applied to detect features

3. **Activation Layer**
   - Introduces non-linearity

4. **Pooling Layer**
   - Down-sampling features

5. **Fully Connected Layer**
   - Combines features for final classification

## Applications of CNNs

- Image classification (e.g., identifying objects)
- Object detection (e.g., locating items in images)
- Image segmentation (e.g., partitioning images into segments)
- Facial recognition
